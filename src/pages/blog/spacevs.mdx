        ## The Big Idea
        Why do I suddenly want to make a shooter game in space? Well, there are two reasons:
        1. I have a big software engineering project in college that this would work great for.

        2. (and this is the main one) Modern first person shooter games do not utilise the 3rd dimension
        to the fullest capacity. Players are restricted to mostly horizontal and lateral movement, with
        little opportunity for viable vertical movement. I want to make a game that changes that.

        ## Research
        Let's look at some games that are popular today, and see how they use the 3rd dimension, and the general mechanics of the game.

        ### Valorant

        Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter where players take on the role of agents with unique abilities.

        The game is played in a series of rounds, where the first team to win 13 rounds wins the game.

        It involves bringing a "spike" (bomb) to a designated area on the map and planting it, while the other team attempts to stop them.

        This brings about an interesting role-reversal, as while the defending team must defend the spike site, if the attackers get through and plant the spike,
        the defenders must then retake the site and become aggressive. This creates a dynamic gameplay loop that keeps the game interesting.

        The game features movement in all directions, but the vertical movement (in most cases) is limited to jumping and crouching. The game is 
        mostly played on a 2D plane, with a few higher up places created to introduce angles that players can shoot from.

        My main takeaway from this game is the mechanics of a tactical shooter, and how the game is balanced around the spike mechanic. I want to
        create someting similar!

        ### Star Citizen

        Star Citizen is a space simulation game that allows players to explore the galaxy, mine resources, trade, and engage in combat.
        For the purposes of this research, I will be focusing on the combat aspect of the game.

        The game features a fully 3D environment, with players able to move in all directions. The game features a variety of ships, each with their own
        unique abilities and weapons.

        Where this game falls short is the hand-to-hand combat. The game is mostly played in ships, and the combat is mostly done with guns and missiles.
        In my game, I want there to be a mix of both ship combat and hand-to-hand combat.

        This game is a great example of how the 3rd dimension can be used in a game. Players can move in all directions, freely rotate themselves in space,
        and engage in combat in a 3D environment. This is the kind of gameplay I want to create in my game.
        

        ## The Plan
        I want to create a game that combines the tactical shooter aspect of Valorant with the 3D movement of Star Citizen. Each team will start on their own planet,
        and must get to the other team's planet to plant a bomb.

        It will include both ship and hand-to-hand combat, with many different strategies to win.
        I want it to be quite open to player creativity, eg. kamakahzi'ing your ship into the enemy planet to take out their defenses.

        [Diagram of idea]

        I will be using Unity to create this game, as it is a powerful game engine that I am familiar with.

        For this devlog, I will be creating a vertical slice of the game. This means I will be creating a small part of the game that includes some of the core mechanics.
        This will help me to get a feel for the game, and see if the idea is viable.

        Let's set out some success criteria for this vertical slice:

        ### Success Criteria
        - Players can join an online matchmaking queue and be matched with other players
        - Players can choose a ship and a character to play as
        - Players can move around on a planet and shoot at each other
        - Players can get into a ship and fly around in space
